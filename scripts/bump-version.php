/**
 * Bump this extension's version in every file that records it.
 *
 * The manifest (plugin.json, or theme.json for a theme) is authoritative:
 * Dixlase core reads it first and only falls back to composer.json. The
 * composer.json copy (top-level "version" for a plugin, extra.dixlase.version
 * for a theme) is easy to forget and then drifts, so this script updates both
 * from one command — and package.json too, when the extension has one.
 * VersionManifestConsistencyTest fails CI if the manifest and composer.json
 * ever disagree.
 *
 * Each file is edited by replacing a single "version" value in place, so the
 * formatting and unescaped unicode are preserved. The edited text is decoded
 * and compared with the expected structure before anything is written, and
 * nothing is written unless every file can be updated.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   php scripts/bump-version.php <x.y.z>
 *   php scripts/bump-version.php 0.2.0
