/**
 * Guards that the manifest and composer.json never disagree on the version.
 *
 * Dixlase core reads the version from the manifest (plugin.json, or theme.json
 * for a theme) first and falls back to composer.json — top-level "version" for
 * a plugin, extra.dixlase.version for a theme. A stale composer.json copy is
 * confusing and resurfaces whenever the fallback is taken, and it has drifted
 * before. Bump every copy together with `php scripts/bump-version.php <x.y.z>`.
 *
 * package.json is kept in step by that script but is deliberately not checked
 * here: nothing in Dixlase reads its version.
 *
 * Pure file reads: no framework boot, no database.
