# Contributing to Dixlase OnePage

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Dixlase OnePage**. This theme is part of the Dixlase Project, and all contributions are governed by the project-wide policies documented in the **Dixlase Core repository**.

The Japanese version of this guide is published as [CONTRIBUTING.ja.md](./CONTRIBUTING.ja.md).

---

## Project-wide policies (canonical)

The following documents in the Dixlase Core repository are authoritative and apply to all contributions, including contributions to this theme:

- **[Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Dixlase/dixlase-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)** — overall workflow, code style, testing, PR conventions
- **[Copyright Policy](https://github.com/Dixlase/dixlase-core/blob/main/COPYRIGHT-POLICY.md)** — high-level licensing stance
- **[Individual CLA](https://github.com/Dixlase/dixlase-core/blob/main/CLA-INDIVIDUAL.md)** — contributor license agreement for individuals
- **[Corporate CLA](https://github.com/Dixlase/dixlase-core/blob/main/CLA-CORPORATE.md)** — contributor license agreement for organizations

This theme does **not** maintain its own copies of the CLA. The canonical CLA in the Core repository is the single source of truth. This avoids drift across plugin/theme repositories.

## Why a CLA is required

**Dixlase OnePage is dual-licensed** under GPL-3.0 + a commercial license offered by exc-D inc. Maintaining this dual-license model legally requires that exc-D be able to sublicense incoming contributions under both license tracks. The CLA grants exc-D the rights necessary to do so, while you retain ownership of your contributions.

In summary, by signing the CLA:

- You **retain ownership** of your contribution
- You **grant exc-D inc.** a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, sublicensable license sufficient to support the dual-license model
- You **agree not to assert moral rights** in a way that would prevent the exercise of that license
- You **confirm** you are authorized to grant the license (employer permission, original creation, third-party material disclosure)

## How to submit your CLA

While the Dixlase Project is in v0.1.x, CLA submission is handled by email:

1. Read the canonical [Individual CLA](https://github.com/Dixlase/dixlase-core/blob/main/CLA-INDIVIDUAL.md) (and [Corporate CLA](https://github.com/Dixlase/dixlase-core/blob/main/CLA-CORPORATE.md) if applicable) in full
2. Fill in the contributor information fields and sign at the bottom
3. Email the completed file to **office@exc-d.com** with the subject `CLA submission — <your name or organization>` and mention which theme(s) and/or plugin(s) you intend to contribute to

A single CLA covers contributions to the entire Dixlase Project — Core and all official plugins/themes. You do not need to sign separate CLAs per repository.

In a future v0.1.x release, this manual workflow will be replaced by [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/), which automates signature collection in the PR flow. When that happens, this section will be updated.

## Contribution scope for themes

When contributing to **Dixlase OnePage**, please follow these theme-specific guidelines in addition to the project-wide ones:

- **Design changes** require a clear visual rationale or accessibility/performance benefit
- **CSS/Tailwind changes** must remain consistent with the existing token system (`@theme` block)
- **Image and font assets** must come with explicit licenses; do not commit assets without confirming the license
- **Dark mode** must continue to work for any new component (use `@variant dark`)
- **Responsive behavior** must be preserved across mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints
